# WeatherAPI

## Description
This is a weather restapi that returns the weather of a city. For now it only returns the temperature for the next few days. The api is built using spring boot and fetches from smhi's open api.

This project is just a side hobby project that I use to learn more about spring boot and rest APIs.

## DONE
- [X] Fetch from multiple weather APIs
- [X] Add spring security
- [X] Add logging
- [X] Add basic error handling
- [X] Compare the results from the different APIs

## TODO
- [ ] Add OpenApi documentation
- [ ] Change my basic caching to use spring boot caching
- [ ] Add more weather APIs
- [ ] Make use of more from each API instead of just the temperature
- [ ] Add more endpoints
